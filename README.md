# Real-Time Iteration MPC for Autonomous Vehicle Control

This project implements a Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm to control an autonomous vehicle modeled using a kinematic bicycle model. The controller tracks reference trajectories while accounting for dynamic and actuation constraints, enabling stable control across different road difficulties and conditions.
